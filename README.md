### About Me

I am a software engineer and I love creating applications that are not only fun, but also have real-world application and use with modern, professional technologies. I am constantly seeking to improve my technical skills and I'm always open to learning new things and connecting with new people. Outside of coding, I also do professional photography work for weddings, engagements, and events as well!
